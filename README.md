The purpose of this repository is to learn more about Javascript, and specifically, how to test-drive code in the language
using Jasmine. The repo contains code for a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors which is to help me gain a better understanding
of the language. 

I also used Express.js to get the game into the browser to learn more about this framework specifically.
